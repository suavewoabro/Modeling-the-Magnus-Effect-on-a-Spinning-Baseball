This project uses various computational techniques to model the force interactions on an idealized baseball spinning through the air from a pitcher's hand to home plate.
The baseball is idealized as a smooth sphere, and is subjected to drag force, force due to gravitational acceleration, and the magnus force due to the spin of the ball. 
Initial conditions including velocity, release angle, and spin are user-input conditions. The Range-Kutta method is used to reduce the second-order differential 
equations of the system to a network of first order differential equations to model the predictable trajectory of the ball. Widgets are used to employ 3d modeling 
techniques and improve display.
